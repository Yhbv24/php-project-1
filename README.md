# Address Book
#### By Ash Laidlaw

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create an address book web app using the following languages and frameworks:

* HTML
* CSS
* PHP
* Silex
* Twig

A user will be able to enter a contact using a form, which will be saved and added to the contact list. A user should be able to empty the list as well.

## Specifications

| Steps | Input | Output |
| :------: | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | User enters form information and clicks submit | User is taken to a new page which displays entered information |
| 2 | Same as Step 1 | Contact information is added to session memory |
| 3 | User clicks "clear" button | Contact list is removed from memory |
