# Address Book
#### By Ash Laidlaw

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create an address book web app using the following languages and frameworks:

* HTML
* CSS
* PHP
* Silex
* Twig

A user will be able to enter a contact using a form, which will be saved and added to the contact list. A user should be able to empty the list as well.

## Specifications

| Steps | Input | Output |
| :------: | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | User clicks button to go to add contact form | User is taken to add contact form |
| 2 | User enters information to add contact and clicks the form button | Contact information is added to session memory and user is taken to a page that shows the most recently added contact |
| 3 | User clicks "view contacts" button | User is taken to page where he/she can view list of contacts |
| 4 | User clicks "clear" button | Entire list of contacts is cleared, user taken home |

## Instructions

To use this app, please clone the repository. The link to the repository is (https://github.com/Yhbv24/php-project-1). Once you have cloned it, you will need to start a server in the web folder. To do that, use Terminal to navigate into the web folder, and type "php -S localhost:8000". That will start the local server, which will let you try out the app. TO stop the server, type CTRL + C in the Terminal window.

## Known Issues

If you refresh the "add_new_contact" page, it will duplicate the contact on that page.
